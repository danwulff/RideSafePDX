## Description

Ride Safe PDX is an Android application that stores and displays bicycle accidents and near-misses. The goal of this project is to provide an app for users to view recent incidents to hopefully be able to avoid dangerous areas. If a bicycle accident or near-miss occurs, a user is able to enter information about the accident after logging in. Details include the type of accident, severity, description, date and time, address, and police report number (if available). Over time, this application will be able to help visualize if there are areas with multiple incidents and be made safer for cyclists.
